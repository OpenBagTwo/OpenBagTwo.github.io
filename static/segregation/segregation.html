<p>Building on T.C. Schelling’s 1971 model of “individually motivated"
racial segregation, we explore the conditions under which segregated
domains coexist with integrated domains in the same system. We employ a
simple agent-based model on a 2D lattice where each agent has some
preference to be near other agents of like type, but which allows for
random movements as well. In attempting to produce the desired results,
we consider two variants: systems in which the randomness of movement
varies from agent-to-agent, and systems in which an external potential
is imposed on the lattice. While the first variant does not lead to the
desired behavior, the second does, and we explore the effects of several
several different potentials on the long-time segregation of the
system.</p>

<h1 id="sec:introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In 1971, T.C. Shelling introduced several dynamic models of racial
segregation, showing how even the slightest preference of individuals to
be near other individuals of like type could produce large-scale
segregation, even in the absence of economic, legal or other global
concerns. In each model, individuals of different “racial" would be
placed on a lattice, and each individual would be classified as “happy"
or “unhappy" based on the “racial" makeup of those around them (e.g.
“happy" if 50% or more of its neighbors were of like-type). If an
individual were “unhappy," it would move to a different site on the
lattice. Schelling’s result was that, even if each individual had very
little racial preference, segregated domains would form on the
lattice<span class="citation" data-cites="Schelling"></span>. Decades
later, physicists discovering the paper recognized its similarity to an
Ising system and consequently suggested improvements<span
class="citation" data-cites="Applications"></span>. Noting that
Schelling’s original model created segregation only on a local level and
did not lead to the formation of large-scale segregated domains (a
disparity that was first noticed and remedied by Jones in 1985<span
class="citation" data-cites="Jones"></span>), Stauffer &amp; Solomon
devised an equivalent <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T%3D0"
alt="T=0" title="T=0" class="math inline" /> Ising-like system,
reproducing Schelling’s original results. By “increasing the
temperature" (that is, increasing the probability of non-ideal moves),
large domains were produced. Of course, if temperature were increased
beyond some critical temperature <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T_c" alt="T_c"
title="T_c" class="math inline" />, the result would be complete
integration<span class="citation"
data-cites="IsingImprovements"></span>. Stauffer &amp; Solomon
interpreted this temperature as a measure of racial tolerance, and while
this might make sense in explaining the phase transition between
segregation and integration, this interpretation doesn’t really make
sense in explaining the behavior at <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T%3D0"
alt="T=0" title="T=0" class="math inline" />. Superficial similarities
have also been noted between urban segregation and metal mixtures in
binary alloys<span class="citation" data-cites="Alloy"></span>.</p>
<p>Up until this point, however, no attempts have been made to explain
the phenomenon of integration and segregation existing side-by-side.
Consider Fig. <a href="#fig:MoCo" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:MoCo">1</a>, a map of the distribution of
ethnicities in Montgomery County, MD, specifically, Downtown Silver
Spring and the surrounding areas. While there is a sharp ethnic divide
on the East-West line to the south of Downtown Silver Spring, Downtown
Silver Spring itself is heavily integrated. While it is, of course,
entirely conceivable that the reason for this phenomenon could be
economic (due to, say, differing property costs) or historical, this
paper seeks to explore, in the words of Schelling, “individually
motivated" reasons for this phenomenon, that is, a model to account for
this phenomenon that can be accounted for exclusively by the
decision-making processes of individuals.</p>

<h1 id="sec:basic">The Basic Model</h1>
<p>Our starting point for these investigations is based on the basic
Schelling model at positive <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T" alt="T"
title="T" class="math inline" />, as outlined by Stauffer &amp;
Solomon<span class="citation" data-cites="IsingImprovements"></span>.
First, we create a 2D (<img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20L%5Ctimes%20L"
alt="L\times L" title="L\times L" class="math inline" />) lattice and
completely fill it with agents of random race. We chose to consider the
case of three races (red, green and blue) at equal proportions. Then, we
delete exactly one site to create a vacancy. An agent <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20i" alt="i"
title="i" class="math inline" /> of race <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20R_i" alt="R_i"
title="R_i" class="math inline" /> is then chosen at random. We proceed
to compute its “energy" both at its current site and at the vacancy:
<img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Clabel%7Beqn%3Aenergy%7DE%5Ei%28x%29%3D%5Csum_%7Bj%3A%20dist%28x%2Cj%29%5Cleq%20r%7DE_%7BR_iR_j%7D"
alt="\label{eqn:energy}E^i(x)=\sum_{j: dist(x,j)\leq r}E_{R_iR_j}"
title="\label{eqn:energy}E^i(x)=\sum_{j: dist(x,j)\leq r}E_{R_iR_j}"
class="math display" /> that is, by considering the interactions with
all agents within some distance <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20r" alt="r"
title="r" class="math inline" /> of the site <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20x" alt="x"
title="x" class="math inline" />.</p>
<p>While the matrix <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20%5Ctilde%20E"
alt="\tilde E" title="\tilde E" class="math inline" /> representing
these interactions could be random, we chose to begin by exploring the
simplest case: <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Ctilde%20E%20%3D%20%5Cleft%28%20%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bccc%7D%0A-1%20%26%200.5%20%26%200.5%20%5C%5C%0A0.5%20%26%20-1%20%26%200.5%20%5C%5C%0A0.5%20%26%200.5%20%26%20-1%5Cend%7Barray%7D%5Cright%29"
alt="\tilde E = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
-1 &amp; 0.5 &amp; 0.5 \\
0.5 &amp; -1 &amp; 0.5 \\
0.5 &amp; 0.5 &amp; -1\end{array}\right)"
title="\tilde E = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
-1 &amp; 0.5 &amp; 0.5 \\
0.5 &amp; -1 &amp; 0.5 \\
0.5 &amp; 0.5 &amp; -1\end{array}\right)" class="math display" /> That
is, agents of like race are “attracted" while agents of differing races
are “repelled."</p>
<p>The individual <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20i" alt="i"
title="i" class="math inline" /> will then move to the new site if the
energy difference <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20%5CDelta%20E%5Ei"
alt="\Delta E^i" title="\Delta E^i" class="math inline" /> between the
vacancy and its current site is less than zero or otherwise with a
probability <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Clabel%7Beqn%3Amove%7DP_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmove%7D%7D%3D%5Cexp%5Cleft%5B-%5Cdfrac%7B%5CDelta%20E%5Ei%7D%7BT%7D%5Cright%5D"
alt="\label{eqn:move}P_{\text{move}}=\exp\left[-\dfrac{\Delta E^i}{T}\right]"
title="\label{eqn:move}P_{\text{move}}=\exp\left[-\dfrac{\Delta E^i}{T}\right]"
class="math display" /> where <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T" alt="T"
title="T" class="math inline" /> describes a “temperature" of the system
(see Section <a href="#subsec:T" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="subsec:T">2.1</a> for an interpretation of this
value).</p>
<p>If the agent moves, it will proceed to occupy the vacancy, and its
old location will become a new vacancy. If the agent does not move,
another agent is selected at random. This simulates the perfect
“seller’s market"–only one vacancy is ever available to be moved into at
any given time, each agent has only two choices (move to that vacancy or
stay where it is), and the only way for the system to advance is for
someone to move to the vacancy.</p>
<p>To correct for certain artifacts in this method, each time a new
agent needs to be selected, there is a probability <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20P_%7BOOT%7D"
alt="P_{OOT}" title="P_{OOT}" class="math inline" /> that we fill the
vacancy with a new, random individual (an “out-of-towner"). In that
case, another agent is selected at random to “move out of town" and
create a new vacancy.</p>

title="T_c" class="math inline" />, integration dominates, agreeing with
the findings of Stauffer &amp; Solomon.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:T">Interpretation of T</h2>
<p>Stauffer &amp; Solomon and others interpreted the temperature <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T" alt="T"
title="T" class="math inline" /> as a measure of the “tolerance" of
individuals in the system, but let’s consider what changing <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T" alt="T"
title="T" class="math inline" /> actually does–as <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T" alt="T"
title="T" class="math inline" /> increases, agents in the system are
more likely to move, even if it would lead them to be ethnically less
“content." If these were real people, we could interpret this as meaning
that these moves were performed for reasons besides ethnic similarity.
In the real world, very few individuals move to a new home based solely
on the ethnic makeup of their neighbors. In fact, according to the 2000
US Census, the number 2 reason for moving (behind “family reasons") was
due to a new job or transfer. If someone were moving to be closer to
work, they might be more likely to discount the ethnic similarity of
their neighbors. So perhaps that can be our interpretation of <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T" alt="T"
title="T" class="math inline" />– that societies (or individuals, as we
will explore in the next section) that are more career-oriented may be
modeled as having higher temperature.</p>
<h1 id="sec:two-T">Two-temperature System</h1>
<p>To attempt to create a system containing both integrated and
segregated neighborhoods, we will begin by creating two classes of
agents, each composed of equal proportions of our three races, but with
class having a different temperature <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T" alt="T"
title="T" class="math inline" />. So now each individual has not only a
race <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20R_i" alt="R_i"
title="R_i" class="math inline" /> but a temperature <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T_i" alt="T_i"
title="T_i" class="math inline" />. Besides that, we made no changes to
the model. Having set the temperature for one group well below <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T_c" alt="T_c"
title="T_c" class="math inline" /> and that for the other above, the
result is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:2class" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:2class">3</a>, and is not what we would have hoped
for. Rather than segregated neighborhoods coexisting with integrated
ones, what we see is segregated neighborhoods with low-<img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T" alt="T"
title="T" class="math inline" /> cores and high-<img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T" alt="T"
title="T" class="math inline" /> edges. This makes some intuitive sense,
as high-T individuals are more willing to move into the “less desirable"
locations on the borders between neighborhoods.</p>

<h1 id="sec:potential">External Potential</h1>
<p>In trying to come up with alternate methods of creating coexisting
integrated and segregated neighborhoods, we considered our real-world
example: Downtown Silver Spring. What if the locale itself were
responsible for the integration? Specifically, what if the presence of
an attraction, something that individuals of all races wanted to be near
(be it a shopping center, a transportation hub, a job locus, or, as in
the case of DTSS, a combination of all of the above), was enough to
override the innate preference towards segregation? To investigate this,
our next round of simulations included the presence of an external
potential overlaid on the lattice of the following form: <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Clabel%7Beqn%3Apotential%7DV%28x%29%3D%5Cleft%5Bdist%28x%2Ca%29%5Cright%5D%5E1"
alt="\label{eqn:potential}V(x)=\left[dist(x,a)\right]^1"
title="\label{eqn:potential}V(x)=\left[dist(x,a)\right]^1"
class="math display" /> where <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20a" alt="a"
title="a" class="math inline" /> is the coordinate of the attraction.
The exponent of <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%201" alt="1"
title="1" class="math inline" /> was chosen based on the idea of
commuting: if someone needs to commute to point <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20a" alt="a"
title="a" class="math inline" />, shaving <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%2010" alt="10"
title="10" class="math inline" /> minutes off the commute is going to be
just as important if it means shortening the commute from <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%2020" alt="20"
title="20" class="math inline" /> minutes to <img

src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%2050" alt="50"
title="50" class="math inline" /> minutes to <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%2040" alt="40"
title="40" class="math inline" />. No cutoff distance was chosen for the
potential–the idea is that all agents on the lattice, no matter how far
out, need to commute to this attraction.</p>
<p>With this potential in mind, we make one small modification to our
model, replacing Eqn. <a href="#eqn:energy" data-reference-type="ref"

distribution shown is the result of <img style="vertical-align:middle"

long run to ensure that this was, indeed, a stable
solution).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fig. <a href="#fig:1attract" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:1attract">4</a> shows the results of this
modification. Even with all members of the population given the same
weighting and the same temperature, we obtain the results we
desired–around the attraction, we have dense integration, while away
from it, we have large segregated domains.</p>
<p>This solution is interesting, as it doesn’t even come close to
minimizing the energy of the system (the solution for energy
minimization, by the way, is independent of the external potential,
since all agents have the same weighting term). This can be explained by
the fact that each agent is “greedy"–it doesn’t care about minimizing
the energy of the whole system, only about minimizing its own energy.
Consider an agent in the center of one of the outlying segregated
regions. For the sake of argument, say all <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%2028" alt="28"
title="28" class="math inline" /> of its neighbors are of the same
color. Now say it has the opportunity to move to a vacancy <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%2022" alt="22"
title="22" class="math inline" /> sites closer to the attraction. Even
if none of the <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%2028" alt="28"
title="28" class="math inline" /> sites in the neighborhood of this
vacancy are of the agent’s type, it will always move to this new site,
even though it <em>increases</em> the overall energy of the system.
Thus, any self-segregation that may occur near the attraction due to
moves of agents already near the attraction will be undone by the influx
of opportunistic agents moving near to the attraction from faraway.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:2attract">Multiple Attractions</h2>
<p>We now consider the case of multiple attractions, which can be
handled in two ways. If each attractor is a necessity to all the agents
in the system (for example, if one attractor is a grocery store and the
other a shopping center), we can think of the potential of the system as
a superposition of the potentials due to each attraction: <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Clabel%7Beqn%3AsumV%7DV%28x%29%3D%5Csum_%5Calpha%5Cleft%5Bdist%28x%2Ca_%5Calpha%29%5Cright%5D%5E1"
alt="\label{eqn:sumV}V(x)=\sum_\alpha\left[dist(x,a_\alpha)\right]^1"
title="\label{eqn:sumV}V(x)=\sum_\alpha\left[dist(x,a_\alpha)\right]^1"
class="math display" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, if both attractions serve the same purpose (for
example, if both are train stations), then all an agent will care about
is which attraction is closer, in other words, the potential will be
determined by the minimum distance to one of the attractions: <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Clabel%7Beqn%3AminV%7DV%28x%29%3D%5Ctext%7Bmin%7D%5Cleft%5C%7B%5Cleft%5Bdist%28x%2Ca_%5Calpha%29%5Cright%5D%5E1%5Cright%5C%7D"

src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20r%5E1"
alt="r^1" title="r^1" class="math inline" /> potentials, the ideal
location, potential-wise, will be anywhere along the line connecting the
two attractions. Indeed, the combined potential in this case will be
stadium-shaped, with a much larger area where the potential isn’t as
steep. Consequently, one might expect our model to segregate more
readily, but as Fig. <a href="#fig:sum" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:sum">5</a> shows, this is not the case. Instead, the
entire “low-potential" region is integrated, while the boundaries are
segregated.</p>

<h1 id="sec:conclusion">Preliminary Conclusions &amp; Further
Investigations</h1>
<p>In seeking to replicate the phenomenon of segregated and integrated
domains coexisting in the same system, we have shown that such behavior
may arise from a universal rule set, that is, it is not necessary for
individuals in the system to have different decision-making processes;
individuals living in integrated urban centers need not be more tolerant
or cosmopolitan or career-oriented than their suburban segregated
compatriots. Similarly, those choosing to live in the segregated suburbs
need not be more bigoted than their integrated counterparts. Our results
suggest that integration can spontaneously arise in systems just by
creating destinations that appeal to all demographics. As each
individual acts in their own best interests, the system as a whole
diverges away from any lowest-energy (segregated) configuration.</p>
<p>Our model, of course, is overly simplistic–it does not take into
account property costs, nor differences between individuals, be they
economic or social. The “ultimate seller’s market" scheme we use may
also contribute to our results, and may help explain why we do not see
segregation re-emerge, even in multi-attraction systems. Further
investigations would study the effect of multiple vacancies, where each
agent would have a choice of where to move, beyond the choice of whether
or not to move at all. We would also like to investigate more
sophisticated energy matrices, that is, if the racial preferences are
unequal (say, Red prefers not to be around Blues more than Blue prefers
not to be around Reds, or Red prefers living near Greens than
Blues).</p>
<p>We would also like to investigate phenomena such as repulsive
potentials (say, due to a garbage dump or a high-crime area, which would
probably be of a form other than <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20r%5E1"
alt="r^1" title="r^1" class="math inline" />), potentials with hard
cut-offs, and regular or irregular potential lattices. It would also be
interesting to investigate real-world topologies (taking into account
uninhabitable zones such as rivers, parks or dense forests). For
example, the ethnic divide to the south of Downtown Silver Spring
happens to fall along Rock Creek Park. We would hope that our model
would reproduce such phenomena.</p>
<p>We allude at several points to the fact that the integrated solutions
are non-ideal, energetically. It is important to point out that our
simulations are all initialized to a random (integrated) configuration,
far from these “ideal" configurations. Continued research would of
course require some trials with the system initialized to one of these
lowest-energy configurations to see whether integration arises even
under those conditions, or whether the phenomena we have seen so far has
merely been the suppression of the formation of segregated domains.</p>
<p>Finally, all the results we present here have been qualitative–we
differentiate between segregation and integration based on how the
system <em>looks</em> rather than by using any mathematical measure. For
example, the total energy of the system, as defined by <img
style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Clabel%7Beqn%3AEtotal%7DE%5E%5Ctext%7Btot%7D%3D%5Csum_iE%5Ei"
alt="\label{eqn:Etotal}E^\text{tot}=\sum_iE^i"
title="\label{eqn:Etotal}E^\text{tot}=\sum_iE^i" class="math display" />
would no-doubt prove a useful measure, especially if we compared it to
the minimum such value possible (a large departure from the minimum
energy would be indicative of integration). This measure would serve as
an order parameter to allow us to study phase transitions in the system
with respect to the tuning parameters <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20T" alt="T"
title="T" class="math inline" /> and <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20W" alt="W"
title="W" class="math inline" />, which were chosen in the above
simulations strictly for the purposes of clear demonstration. This would
allow for a far more rigorous treatment of the material than we have
performed so far. Furthermore, we believe it might be possible to
analytically derive some properties of the equilibrium conditions, for
example, in the single-attractor case, the radius of the integrated
neighborhood (we suspect, but have not yet attempted to verify, that
this condition is that the expectation value for the energy–both
potential and racial–of an agent at the edge must be equal to either the
energy of the most remote agent or the average energy of all outlying
agents). These types of analysis would not only strengthen our results,
but our methods might prove applicable to other related systems.</p>
