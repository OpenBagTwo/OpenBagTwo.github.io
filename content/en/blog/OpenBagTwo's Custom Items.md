***[https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/chappeau/](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/chappeau/)***

This repo contains a **resourcepack** that adds custom items to the game without replacing the original items.

It requires no mods, and use of any datapacks is purely optional (the datapack in this repo allows you to
obtain items in survival / without commands, and I strongly recommend
[the Armor Statues Datapack](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
for infinite posability and placement possibilities).
As such, it should be broadly compatible across recent versions of Java Minecraft.


## Datapack

This repo also contains a **datapack** for obtaining some of these items in survival.

### Coffee and Espresso

With the datapack installed in your world, any brewing stand named "Hairo V60" or "Chemex" will brew coffee and espresso
instead of potions (they'll all still have their original effects, just with custom names and textures).

### "3D printing" custom items

To obtain any of the other custom items, craft a hopper and, using an anvil, name it
"[Enderman 3 Pro](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-pro-3d-printer)".
Directly below where you place this hopper, place a **glow item frame**, face up.

Then, load any of the base (replaced) items listed above in the first slot, and in the second slot, place a piece of paper
with the names listed for each item above (all will be lowercase, with underscores instead of spaces, and ending in ".gcode").

With the datapack running, the base item will then be removed from the hopper, and the custom item will appear on the ~~heated bed~~
glow item frame.
