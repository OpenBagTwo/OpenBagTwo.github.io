One of my favorite projects from grad school was not even related to my PhD.
It was a project for
[PHYS615](https://umdphysics.umd.edu/academics/courses/930-physics-615-nonlinear-dynamics-of-extended-systems.html),
a nonlinear dynamics course with a heavy emphasis on scientific computing and simulation.

The simulation I was exploring was a famous agent-based model devised by econophysicist
[Thomas Schelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling%27s_model_of_segregation), which
suggested how populations might self-segregate, even if individuals had only _the slightest_ preference
to be around neighbors of similar backgrounds.

For this project, I decided to add some new parameters to the simulation in order try and
articulate why urban centers might be more integrated than suburbs, like you see in
[my home county](http://www.justupthepike.com/2010/09/mapping-racial-ethnic-integration-in.html):

(s/o to my best friend, and author of the _Just Up THe Pike_ blog, Dan Reed).

[The focus of my investigation](/segregation/segregation.html) was whether inherent biases could be overcome by an _overriding_ desire,
such as wanting to be close to a [bustling urban center](https://www.downtownsilverspring.com/), or
whether these simulations would simply result in segregated neighborhoods close to the "attraction."

Rereading this paper almost half my lifetime after I wrote it, I really do want to go back and pursue those
["further investigations"](/segregation/segregation.html#sec:conclusion) I outlined:
- I'd love to see quantitative graphs of total energy vs. the tuning parameters _T_ and _W_
- I'd love to really try and determine what conditions _would_ lead to small-scale segregated areas or whether
  multiple equivalent "attractions" would result in single groups claiming their own.

I'd also like to go back to the literature and see if _anyone else_ has explored these ideas.

And who knows? One day, maybe I will.
