Fox Nap is a simple "Vanilla Plus" mod for adding custom music discs to Minecraft.

* Unlike what you can achieve with
  [resource packs alone](https://www.planetminecraft.com/blog/how-to-add-costume-music-the-easy-way-1-12/)
  music discs added via Fox Nap **do not overwrite** the vanilla music discs.
* Unlike similar mods, Fox Nap allows you to:
    * add as many or as few music discs as you want
    * add _whatever_ music you want
    * use _different_ music than other players on the same server
    * obtain all music discs in survival, via a new villager profession

Fox Nap also adds custom musical instruments that you can play like goat horns,
giving you the creative freedom to stage
"live music" [performances](https://www.google.com/search?q=lip+syncing+concert).

This mod makes your custom music discs obtainable in survival via
by trading with _The Maestro_, a new villager who has a Jukebox as a job site.

The Maestro will pay top dollar for [tonewood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonewood)--stripped
blocks of rare wood types--goat horns and non-Fox Nap records and sells, alongside your custom
music discs, a wide variety of playable musical instruments (with textures adopted from the classic
[mxTune mod](https://github.com/AeronicaMC/mxTune)).
