I'm a Data Scientist, Python developer and and all-around nerd, living in the Washington, DC area,  committed to doing well by doing good.

I believe the data speak for themselves, but mostly they're asking questions.

I'm skeptical of AI and ML, less so because of the ethics than because honestly a logistic regression or a decision tree would have achieved the same result nine times out of ten.

I breathe in Python and dream in SQL (and am consequently one of the dozen or so people in the world who genuinely loves [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)).

Thanks to my kid (pictured riding "seagull"), I'm a huge fan of Minecraft, and a lot of my side-projects are around modding and exploring the Minecraft data structures.



While I have strong opinions about Linux, software licenses, programming paradigms, agile frameworks and style guides, but I try to keep them to myself.

I have a Doctorate in Physics, specializing in nonlinear dynamics and network theory, and I've been employed as a Data Scientist since 2013 (having volunteered as one for four years before that).
